# Pacman Animation

## Description

Pacman is synonimous with the birth of video games. Transending arcade machines to personal computers, and later smartphones, this simple game has captured the imagination, and frustration of gamers and programmers alike. 

## Functionality

This animation relies on HTML and JS to prototype the chomping movement of Pacman, changing direction when coliding with the screen boundaries. This animation is limited to this scope, and is not a full recreation of the original game.
